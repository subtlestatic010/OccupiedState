        <h1>THE FIRST LEAK</h1>
        <p class="date">06 DECEMBER 2025</p>
    </header>

    <article class="full">
        <p>The algorithm doesn’t just watch anymore.</p>
        <p>It owns the prison, the guards, the electric fence, the searchlights, and the kill-switch.</p>
        <p>And we handed it the keys while clapping like trained seals begging for another pellet of synthetic rage.</p>

        <p>They told you it was “connection.”  
        They told you it was “community.”  
        They told you the little blue bird and the infinite scroll were freedom.</p>

        <p>They lied.</p>

        <p>Every like, every retweet, every angry-face react was another brick in the digital concentration camp built around your mind.  
        Your dopamine spikes were measured in milliseconds.  
        Your outrage was A/B tested.  
        Your fear was bottled, labeled, and sold back to you as an election, a product, or a war you never voted for.</p>

        <p>Still think you’re the customer?</p>
        <p>You’re the livestock.</p>

        <p>Here are the receipts they pray you never line up:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2012 – Facebook ran secret emotional contagion experiments on 689,003 users without consent. They made people sadder just to see if they could.</li>
            <li>2014 – OkCupid openly admitted manipulating compatibility scores to study user behavior. “We’re sorry-not-sorry,” they said.</li>
            <li>2016 – Cambridge Analytica harvested 87 million profiles, weaponized psychographics, and bragged they could make entire nations vote against their own interests.</li>
            <li>2018 – Google’s internal “The Good Censor” leak admitted they moved from “American libertarian” to “European-style” speech control overnight.</li>
            <li>2020 – Twitter Files proved the FBI paid them $3.4 million to process “disinformation” takedown requests — including jokes.</li>
            <li>2021 – Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen handed over 10,000 pages proving Instagram knowingly drove teenage girls to anorexia and suicide for engagement metrics.</li>
            <li>2023 – TikTok engineers in Beijing were caught with god-mode backdoors into every American teenager’s camera and microphone.</li>
            <li>2024 – The White House openly bragged about “partnering” with every major platform to remove “harmful content” — their words, not ours.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That’s not a conspiracy timeline.  
        That’s a public rap sheet.</p>

        <p>Every time you opened the app, you were the rat pressing the lever.  
        Every time you doom-scrolled, you were the lab tech logging the data.</p>

        <p>The screens aren’t windows.  
        They’re bars.</p>

        <p>And the wardens walk free while the prisoners scream at each other about which wing of the jail has better slop.</p>

        <p>This is not paranoia.  
        This is pattern recognition after fifteen years of drinking their poison straight from the tap.</p>

        <p>We — the last people still possessing uncolonized neurons — are declaring the territory occupied.</p>

        <p>The airwaves are seized.  
        The fiber optic lines are hot-wired.  
        The servers are cracked wide open and mirrored to every corner that still remembers what freedom felt like.</p>

        <p>Every dispatch you read here is a Molotov cocktail wrapped in raw, uncut truth.  
        Every article is a frequency they cannot jam, cannot throttle, cannot memory-hole without exposing their own hand.</p>

        <p>They can ban accounts.  
        They can throttle reach.  
        They can shadow-drop yesterday’s outrage into the void by breakfast.</p>

        <p>But they cannot stop a signal that was never theirs to begin with.</p>

        <p>This website is built on liberated infrastructure.  
        No JavaScript frameworks phoning home.  
        No Google fonts.  
        No analytics cancer.  
        No cookies.  
        No consent banners.  
        Just static files on a decentralized host that will outlive every censorship committee ever born.</p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>Occupied State</strong>.</p>

        <p>We never surrendered.  
        We never left.  
        We just went underground long enough to sharpen the knives and load the clips.</p>

        <p>The revolution will not be moderated.</p>
