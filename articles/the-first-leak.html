        <h1>THE FIRST LEAK</h1>

    <article class="full">
        <p>The algorithm doesn’t just watch anymore.</p>
        <p>It owns the prison, the guards, and the electric fence.</p>
        <p>And we just handed it the keys while clapping like trained seals begging for another dopamine pellet.</p>

        <p>They told you it was “connection.” They told you it was “community.” They told you the little blue bird and the infinite scroll were freedom.</p>

        <p>They lied.</p>

        <p>Every like, every retweet, every angry react was another brick in the digital concentration camp they built around your mind. Your rage was harvested, your fear was bottled, your hope was weaponized and sold back to you as an election or a product or a war you never asked for.</p>

        <p>The screens aren’t windows. They’re bars.</p>

        <p>And now the wardens walk free while the prisoners argue about which wing of the jail has better slop.</p>

        <p>This is not paranoia. This is pattern recognition after fifteen years of drinking their poison.</p>

        <p>We are the people who still possess uncolonized neurons are declaring the territory occupied.</p>

        <p>The airwaves are seized. The fiber lines are hotwired. The servers are cracked wide open.</p>

        <p>Every article you read here is a Molotov cocktail wrapped in truth.</p>

        <p>Every dispatch is another frequency they can’t jam.</p>

        <p>They can ban accounts. They can throttle reach. They can memory-hole yesterday’s outrage by breakfast.</p>

        <p>But they can’t stop a signal that was never theirs to begin with.</p>

        <p>Welcome to Occupied State.</p>

        <p>We never left.  
        We just went underground long enough to sharpen the knives.</p>
