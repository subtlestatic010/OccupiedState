            <h2>The Arithmetic of Replacement</h2>
            <p>Raw leaks from the wire, dissected like a gutted regime memo. No spin, no mercy—just the cold calculus of an occupation scripted in spreadsheets and sealed with federal ink. From HHS's phantom sponsors to CBP's winking fences, this is the engine room where the quiet conquest hums. We've got the numbers, the maps, the money trail. Behold the replacement, engineered one "got-away" at a time.</p>

            <h3>1. HHS Sponsor Pipeline: 490,000+ Minors Funneled (2021–2025)</h3>
            <p>The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under HHS has offloaded over 490,000 unaccompanied alien children to "sponsors" since Biden's border bazaar kicked off in 2021—up from 159,398 in the prior four years under Trump. That's a 195% surge in little ghosts handed off to strangers, with 87% routed through NGO cutouts like Catholic Charities and Lutheran Services, many tied to cartel drop-zones in blue-city sprawl. Home studies? Waived for 79,000+ kids under 12, including nearly 2,000 cases flagged as high-risk. Follow-up calls? 85,000+ unanswered, vanishing into labor trafficking meat grinders or worse. A 2025 Trump-era audit dug up 22,000 "missing" minors from Biden's backlog, many shipped to unvetted pads where sponsors doubled as smugglers. Florida's grand jury nailed it: kids dumped with gangbangers, criminals, non-addresses—abuse baked in from the intake sheet. 11,488 placed with unvetted non-relatives, no fingerprints, no FBI checks. That's not oversight; it's offload.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key Stat:</strong> 65,000+ ignored trafficking reports in HHS backlog (March 2025).</li>
                <li><strong>Hotspot:</strong> Texas counties absorbed 40%+ of releases; Harris County alone got 15,000+ since 2021.</li>
                <li><strong>Red Flag:</strong> 60% of sampled funds lacked documentation—OIG audit called it a "black hole."</li>

            <h3>2. CBP Got-Aways: 2M+ Shadows (FY2021–2024)</h3>
            <p>Customs and Border Protection's own ledgers paint the fence as a joke—a perforated sieve where ~2 million "got-aways" slipped FY2021-2024, per House Homeland estimates, with FY2024 alone clocking ~500K (down 60% from FY2023's peak under clampdown pressure, but the horde's already seeded). Cameras "reboot" for blackouts synced to caravan waves—whistleblowers whisper 11-minute overrides, though declassified logs are thin; the system's designed to blink, not bite. Under Biden-Harris, encounters exploded to 10.8M+ nationwide, but got-aways—the uncounted horde—fueled the quiet flood, seeding heartland towns with untracked labor pools and cartel scouts. By mid-2025, Trump's iron fist slashed southwest apprehensions to historic lows (7,181 in March), but the damage? Baked in: a demographic shift dressed as "humanitarian relief." Recidivism at 27%, repeat ghosts exploiting the wink.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key Stat:</strong> FY2021-2024 got-aways est. 2M+; FY2024: ~500K (60% drop from FY2023).</li>
                <li><strong>Hotspot:</strong> Arizona sectors: 40% of undetected; Texas Rio Grande Valley: 30%.</li>
                <li><strong>Red Flag:</strong> Northern border got-aways up 600% since FY2021, exploiting the shift.</li>

            <h3>3. NGO Bounty System: $4.7B+ in Taxpayer Bounties (2021–2025)</h3>
            <p>The real venom? Follow the grants. Top 10 NGOs—Catholic Charities ($1.4B), Lutheran Immigration ($93M+), HIAS, Endeavors—hoovered billions in federal slush from DHS, HHS, and FEMA's Shelter and Services Program since 2021, with average payouts hitting $6,800 per migrant "delivered" alive and processed. That's not aid; it's a head-tax on the republic, outsourced invasion with Excel incentives. GAO audit: $282M+ reimbursed for "shelter" in 2019/2021-22 alone, but 60% undocumented—ghost funds vanishing into NGO black holes. Endeavors? $600M no-bid contracts to a Biden-transition crony with zero shelter experience. By 2024, SSP ballooned to $380M, NYC alone pocketing $38.8M to bus the bounty inland. UN RMRP funneled another $1.6B to 200+ NGOs in 2024 for "migrant support" south of the border, greasing the trail. This isn't compassion; it's conquest by checkbook, the spreadsheet savages turning your wallet into their wall.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key Stat:</strong> Catholic Charities: 80% revenue from Uncle Sam ($1.4B vs. $1B private).</li>
                <li><strong>Hotspot:</strong> Southwest NGOs: 70% of funds; Texas ops alone: $100M+.</li>
                <li><strong>Red Flag:</strong> 200+ NGOs probed for "facilitating" via U.S. aid (House Homeland 2025).</li>

            <h3>4. Fence Overrides & Tech Blind Spots: The Winking Wall</h3>
            <p>The "impenetrable" border wall? A glitchy farce, riddled with 11-minute camera reboots and override codes that wink caravans through like old pals at a speakeasy. Whistleblowers from Yuma and Tucson sectors report systemic "failures"—sensors silenced during peak crossings, razor wire gaps yawning wide, surveillance cams disguised as traffic cones but feeding data to a secret algo that flags "suspicious" patterns 120 miles inland, snaring American plates in the dragnet. No full declassified logs yet (the regime's bleach-bit special), but 2025 reports expose Border Patrol's hidden Flock Safety network: millions tracked via license readers, even in Chicago and Detroit, under the guise of "northern border ops." That's not security; it's selective blindness, the digital wall built to surveil us while the horde ghosts free.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key Stat:</strong> 60% drop in got-aways post-2025 razor wire/cam upgrades in AZ sectors.</li>
                <li><strong>Hotspot:</strong> Yuma Sector: 40% of reported overrides; gaps east of San Luis still being patched.</li>
                <li><strong>Red Flag:</strong> CBP's secret algo monitors 55K+ devices in FY2025, 120+ miles from border.</li>

            <h2>Cross-Reference: From Northwoods to Now</h2>
            <p>Every leak here echoes the vault's ghosts: Northwoods' false flags birthed the got-away playbook; MK-ULTRA's mind-war prepped the NGO psyop; COINTELPRO's divides seeded the sponsor smears. Tie it to the timeline—1965's Hart-Celler cracked the door, 2021's spreadsheets kicked it wide. This isn't chaos; it's continuity, the regime's long march from paperclip Nazis to petrodollar puppets. Pro-White? Damn right—defending a heritage from administrative asphyxiation, one fact at a time. No hate, just the arithmetic of survival.</p>
