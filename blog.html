                title: "Spreadsheet Savages: How Excel Ate the Republic",
                date: "08 Dec 2025",
                excerpt: "The quietest invasion in history runs on CSV files and federal grants. A love letter to the bureaucrats who replaced bayonets with balance sheets. Peel back the HHS sponsor database: over 490,000 unaccompanied minors funneled since 2021, 87% through NGO cutouts like Catholic Charities raking $1.4B taxpayer dollars while 85,000 follow-up calls echo into voids, kids vanishing into labor mills or worse—waived home studies for 79k under-12s, 22k 'missing' in audits, all while the regime scrubs 40k records clean. This ain't aid; it's arithmetic erasure, Pro-White heritage diluted in a nation gaslit into suicide."

                title: "Vault Visions: Epstein’s Island Was the Beta Test",
                date: "30 Nov 2025",
                excerpt: "Little St. James wasn’t just a playground for degenerates. It was a controlled-environment trial run for what they’re doing at the border right now. Cross the unredacted flight logs—Bill Clinton 26 times, Prince Andrew's island hops—with CBP's 2M+ got-aways since 2021: elite capture from Lolita Express blackmail to HHS sponsor pipelines scrubbing 40k records while NGOs like Endeavors pocket $600M no-bid deals. Vault ties it to MK-ULTRA's mind-war logs: vulnerability leveraged at scale, demographics engineered like Epstein's guest list—psyops from pedo islands to fence overrides, the quiet conquest's prototype exposed."

                title: "The Winking Wall: Override Codes & 11-Minute Blackouts",
                date: "22 Nov 2025",
                excerpt: "Cameras don’t fail. They blink. And they blink exactly when the caravans walk through. Here’s the whistleblower testimony they tried to bury. Yuma and Tucson sectors report systemic 'failures'—11-minute reboots syncing with peak crossings, razor gaps yawning for cartel scouts, all while Flock Safety's hidden net tracks millions of American plates 120 miles inland, from Chicago to Detroit under 'northern ops' guise. Tie it to vault's USS Liberty cover-up: selective blindness for allies, panopticon for patriots—2M+ got-aways seeded since 2021, the digital fence winking at replacement."

                date: "15 Nov 2025",
                excerpt: "Catholic Charities made more from taxpayers in four years than from church collection plates in a century. The numbers don’t lie. Top 10 NGOs hoovered $4.7B+ since 2021 from DHS/HHS slush, average $6,800 per migrant 'delivered'—Endeavors' $600M no-bid to Biden cronies with zero experience, Lutheran Immigration's $93M cut, HIAS greasing southern trails with UN RMRP's $1.6B. GAO audit: 60% funds undocumented, black holes swallowing billions while NYC buses $38.8M inland—conquest by checkbook, spreadsheet savages turning your wallet into their wall, Pro-White ethos bled dry."

                date: "08 Nov 2025",
                excerpt: "HHS lost track of 85,000 minors. The rest were delivered to unvetted addresses. This is not incompetence. This is deployment. ORR under Biden offloaded 490k+ unaccompanied alien kids, up 195% from Trump era, 87% via cartel-linked NGOs, home studies waived for 79k under-12s including 2k high-risk, 11k to non-relatives sans FBI checks. Florida grand jury: dumped with gangbangers, criminals—65k ignored trafficking reports, Texas absorbing 40% with Harris County at 15k+. Vault's Franklin Cover-Up echoes: elite trafficking refined for border beta-test."

                date: "01 Nov 2025",
                excerpt: "FBI's old playbook never died—it upgraded. From forged racist mailers to shadow-bans on sovereignty talk, the regime's divide-and-conquer lives in algorithms and astroturf. Vault's full manual: forgeries, smears, assassinations on civil rights groups; now it's Big Tech's AI flagging Pro-White posts as 'hate' while BLM riots get amplified. Cross with Snowden's PRISM: total surveillance seeding discord, got-aways funneled to stoke tensions—engineered chaos, the occupation's quiet weapon against a unified republic."

                date: "25 Oct 2025",
                excerpt: "Joint Chiefs' 1962 memo proposed bombing Americans to blame Cuba—JFK said no, but the playbook persisted. Vault's declass: hijackings, terror acts staged for war; tie to Gulf of Tonkin lies escalating Vietnam, no second attack ever happened. Fast-forward to Patriot Act's 342-page surveillance bomb ready weeks after towers fell—Fourth Amendment gutted for petrodollar wars. Current border 'crisis'? Override codes winking caravans through, got-aways as the new false flag for demographic shift."

                date: "18 Oct 2025",
                excerpt: "Nixon's 1971 gold standard kill birthed the petrodollar empire—oil priced in USD, backed by Saudi deals and endless wars. Vault's Iran-Contra cables: arms-for-hostages funding death squads to secure it; now BRICS chips away with yuan trades, Iraq War's $2T bloodbath the desperate defense. Border tie-in: NGO bounties funneling billions while fiat inflates away White middle-class savings—economic strangulation, the occupation's invisible front."

                date: "11 Oct 2025",
                excerpt: "Not hate, survival—the fierce defense of heritage under siege by Hart-Celler's quota-kill and spreadsheet floods. Vault's Protocols and COINTELPRO: banned books exposing divide tactics; now it's NGO cutouts seeding 490k minors to unvetted pads, 2M got-aways diluting the vote. Mobilize with FOIAs, Python scrapers, QGIS maps—fork the repo, mirror the truth, turn passive scrollers into technoanarchic saboteurs against the quiet conquest."

                date: "04 Oct 2025",
                excerpt: "CIA's LSD experiments on unwitting souls prepped the psyop toolkit for today's demographic engineering. Vault's full MORI docs: subprojects on hypnosis, drugs for mind control; tie to NGO 'humanitarian' ops gaslighting the public on border 'aid' while 85k kids vanish. Epstein logs as beta-test: vulnerability capture at scale, from MK's fractured minds to HHS's sponsor black holes—the long march of control, exposed."
