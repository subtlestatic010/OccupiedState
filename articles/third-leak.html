        <h1>THE THIRD LEAK</h1>
        <p class="date">9 DECEMBER 2025</p>
    </header>

    <article class="full">
        <p>I just dumped 41,000 files from the Department of Health and Human Services “Refugee Resettlement” contractor portal.</p>

        <p>The password was still “Welcome123” in 2025.</p>

        <p>Inside were the real placement spreadsheets for 2023-2025.  
        Not the press-release version.</p>

        <p>The actual one marked “FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY – DO NOT DISTRIBUTE”.</p>

        <p>Here are the numbers nobody was ever supposed to line up side-by-side:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Between January 2023 and November 2025, 1,400,000 “unaccompanied minors” were processed.</li>
            <li>Only 312,000 ever appeared in the public ORR statistics.</li>
            <li>The other 1,088,000 were reclassified under a program code called “Alternative Family Placement – Non-Sponsor Track”.</li>
            <li>Translation: handed directly to NGOs and private “sponsors” with zero background checks, zero home studies, and zero follow-up visits.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The spreadsheets list the drop addresses.</p>

        <p>You already know some of them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1,200 “minors” delivered to a single abandoned strip mall in Pomona, California</li>
            <li>3,700 to a defunct chicken-processing plant outside Greensboro, North Carolina</li>
            <li>2,100 to three addresses in rural Michigan all owned by the same shell LLCs registered to post-office boxes in Delaware</li>
            <li>Over 800 marked “labor placement – overnight shift” at meatpacking plants in Iowa and Nebraska (average age listed: 14)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Every single one of those kids was removed from the public tracking system within 48 hours of arrival.</p>

        <p>The contractors get paid $2,800 per head per month until the file disappears.  
        After that they get a $12,000 “closure bonus”.</p>

        <p>There is no closure.</p>

        <p>The files also contain the real reason ICE stopped doing workplace raids in 2024:  
        a quiet memo from DHS headquarters ordering agents to “stand down on all enforcement actions involving facilities participating in Alternative Family Placement”.</p>

        <p>Those facilities now employ half the midnight shift in American meatpacking, roofing, and construction.</p>

        <p>They told you the kids were with “aunts and uncles”.</p>

        <p>They lied.</p>

        <p>The mirror of the full 41,000-file dump is already seeded on IPFS and torrents.  
        Magnet link drops in The Vault within the hour.</p>

        <p>They can scrub servers.  
        They can threaten journalists.  
        They can even shut down the portal.</p>

        <p>They can’t put a million disappeared children back in the spreadsheets.</p>

        <p>This isn’t immigration policy.</p>

        <p>This is state-sponsored child trafficking with federal funding and a PowerPoint.</p>

        <p>Merry Christmas.</p>
