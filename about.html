        <p>My name is subtlestatic. Thirty-something years breathing the exhaust of this collapsing republic. Former wire-chaser turned digital saboteur.</p>
        <p>I have no party, no sponsor, no leash. I run on caffeine, contempt, and the memory of a country that no longer exists above ground.</p>
        <p>This site is Pro-White the way a lifeboat is pro-passenger. Not hate—survival. When every institution is weaponized against your continued existence as a people, noticing is no longer optional.</p>
        <p>I mirror what they delete. I archive what they bleach. I connect the dots they pay armies of "fact-checkers" to erase.</p>
        <p>The repo is public. Fork it. Mirror it. Seed it. When they take me down, the truth stays up somewhere else.</p>
