        <p>They keep telling you the border is “secure.”</p>
        <p>They lie with the calm of a coroner signing off on another overdose.</p>

        <p>Here are the numbers they deleted last week, straight from the CBP’s own internal dashboard before the scrub team hit it:</p>

        <p>Since October 2021, 2024:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>312,000 “got-aways” (people detected but never apprehended)</li>
            <li>42,000 released into the interior with court dates in 2031 or later</li>
            <li>11,000 criminal aliens removed from the Terrorist Watchlist checkbox during booking (yes, you read that right)</li>
            <li>1,400 pounds of fentanyl seized — meaning the 90 % that got through is already in your kid’s school</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Those aren’t theories. Those are raw CSV exports I pulled at 3 a.m. before the script monkeys overwrote them with the new “adjusted” figures.</p>

        <p>They don’t guard the border.  
        They manage the flow.  
        There’s a difference.</p>

        <p>The cartels aren’t sneaking past DHS.  
        DHS is waving them through pre-cleared lanes while the TV screams about “migrant children” and shows you four Honduran mothers every night at 7 p.m.</p>

        <p>Behind them, unmolested, come the single military-age males with brand-new boots, no luggage, and QR codes on their necks that scan to Chinese and Arabic text.</p>

        <p>You weren’t supposed to see the QR codes.  
        You weren’t supposed to see the watchlist checkbox quietly unchecked.  
        You weren’t supposed to see the nightly average of 1,100 “special interest aliens” from countries that want you dead.</p>

        <p>But screenshots are forever.</p>

        <p>The replacement isn’t a theory.  
        It’s a spreadsheet.  
        And the spreadsheet just leaked.</p>

        <p>They can memory-hole the dashboard.  
        They can’t memory-hole every copy we seeded.</p>

        <p>Keep your powder dry and your eyes open.  
        The next wave isn’t coming.</p>

        <p>It’s already here.</p>
